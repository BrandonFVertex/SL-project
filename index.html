MUDs are online roleplaying games where the user can create a character to immerse themselves in a fantastical world as if they're starring in a fantasy book like "Percy Jackson" or "Harry Potter"</p2>

 <h3>[Personal Experience or Tips]</h3>
 <p2>My father and uncle before me were gamers, I can even remember a story where my father was thinking about how he'd think about using the flute to get to the next world in the old Super Mario game for the NES (Nintendo entertainment system) while he was in school and my uncle introduced me to gaming when he allowed me to play on his PS3 back when I was around 7 or 8. He let me play games such as Minecraft and little big planet 3. With these games, I truly fell in love with video games.</p2>
