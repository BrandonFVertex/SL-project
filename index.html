      <h2> [Introduction]</h2>
      <p2>Online Gaming is a simple hobby where a person takes time out there day to just get on their phone or a console or something of the sort and have a nice gaming session </p2>
 <h2> [The History Of Gaming]</h2>
 <p2>Online gaming dates back as far as 50 years ago. It all started with second-person text-based RPG games known as "MUDs" or multi-user dungeons. MUDs are online roleplaying games where the user can create a character to immerse themselves in a fantastical world as if they're starring in a fantasy book like "Percy Jackson" or "Harry Potter"</p2>
 <h2>[Tools and Equipment]</h2> 
 <p2>The cool thing about online gaming is that lots of tech has it. From next-generation consoles like the PlayStation 5 Pro or the Xbox Series X, to those as small and dated as an Obama phone.</p2>
 <h2>Techniques and Skills</h2>
 <p2>Online gaming teaches gamers a lot of skills they can use in the real world. Online gamingâ€™s different genres of games helps teach puzzle-solving skills (through puzzle games.) As well as social skills and communication skills through games such as Call of duty or Rainbow Six Siege. (Both of which are 5-player first-person shooters.)</p2>
